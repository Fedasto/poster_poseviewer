# 📱 poster_poseviewer

**Real-time photogrammetry streamed directly from your smartphone**

poster_poseviewer enables live capture of images or video frames from a
mobile device and streams them to a photogrammetry backend for
**real-time 3D reconstruction**.\
The tool is designed for **experimentation, research, academic demos,
and rapid testing**, with a special focus on **scientific poster
sessions and conference presentations**.

**Version:** 1.0\
**Developed for:** BicoQ Poster Competition

-   Live image or frame streaming from a smartphone\
-   Real-time photogrammetry pipeline\
-   Built using **OpenCV** and other open‑source libraries\
-   Created for research, education, and demo purposes --- **not for
    commercial use**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🧩 Requirements

-   Python 3.10+\
-   OpenCV\
-   Additional dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🚀 Quick Start
